# lpg2sfz
Basic tool that converts One Small Clue Grace's files (.lpg) into .sfz ***(only sample mapping)***

I made this tool as an easy way to map samples and preview them with Grace, just to port them into SFZ and make the rest in that format. This is a good choice for people who prefers mapping the samples visually.

## Preparing the .lpg file

Before using this tool, you should export your Grace project as **Menu -> Save Program + Samples As...**

## How to use it

With the .jar file, execute it on the same folder of the .lpg file you want to convert, then, with cmd, write `java -jar lpg2sfz.jar "your file.lpg"` being `"your file.lpg` the one you want to use, run and done, you will see a `your file.lpg.sfz` on the same folder.
